# Simple-Text-Based-Adventure-Game
This is a beginner-friendly Python game where the player goes on a mini adventure based on the choices they make. It uses simple `input()` and `if/else` statements to drive the story.

## How the Game Works

- The game starts by asking the player's name and if they want to play.
- Based on their choice to go **left** or **right**, the story unfolds:
  - Going **left** leads to a river where the player must decide between swimming or using a boat.
  - Going **right** leads to an unexpected fall off a cliff.

Each choice leads to a different outcome — win, lose, or restart!

## Features

- User interaction with input prompts
- Basic decision-making using conditional logic
- Simple storyline with multiple endings
- Personalized messages using the player’s name

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Copy the code into a file called `adventure_game.py`.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python adventure_game.py
